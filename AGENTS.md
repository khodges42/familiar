# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents contributing to this repo.

## Notes
* There are character images for testing with in characters/proxy/source_images/ with 6 expressions.

## Engineering

* Prefer the simplest solution that satisfies the requirement.
* Do not implement speculative future requirements.
* Extend existing systems before creating new ones.
* Determine whether an existing implementation can be extended before introducing a new subsystem, abstraction, or dependency.
* Always defer to the user when requirements are unclear or tradeoffs are uncertain.
* New dependencies require justification.
* Never duplicate functionality unless doing so avoids unnecessary dependency complexity.

## Documentation

* Use direct, humble technical language, Write like an engineer, not a marketer.
* Be accurate and honest about capabilities and limitations.
* Record known bugs, limitations, and technical debt in `docs/BUGS.md`.
* If there is information worth communicating after completing work, append it to `docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.



## Source of Truth
